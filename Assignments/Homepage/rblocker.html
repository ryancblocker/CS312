<h2> Some things I like to do in my free time </h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Skiing:</strong> Preferrably over a weekend with my friends</li>
  <li><strong>Photography:</strong> When I was a junior in HS I had the opportunity to go fully around the world with Semester at Sea. I went to over 14 countries and 21 cities. Overall I think I traveled over 24,000 nautical miles with my camera. </li>
  <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> My all time favorite game is Spider-Man PS4 that was released in 2018 by Insomniac Games. However my friends are trying to get me back into Destiny 2 and Minecraft at the moment. </li>
  <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Since I have had the immense previlage of traveling so much for my age I have learned to love so many kinds of food. However my personal favorite to cook is french cuisine.</li>
</ul>
