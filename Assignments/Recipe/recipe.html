  <h2> Ingriedients </h2>

    <hr>

    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>6 ounces (170g) bacon, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>3 pounds (1 1/2 kg) beef brisket, trimmed of fat (chuck steak or stewing beef) cut into 2-inch chunks
</li>
      <li>1 large carrot sliced 1/2-inch thick</li>
      <li>1 large white onion, diced</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, minced (divided)</li>
      <li>1 pinch coarse salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
      <li>12 small pearl onions (optional)</li>
      <li>3 cups red wine like Merlot, Pinot Noir, or a Chianti -- for a milder sauce, use only 2 cups of wine</li>
      <li>2-3 cups beef stock (if using 2 cups of wine, use 3 cups beef stock)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 beef bullion cube, crushed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped (divided)</li>
      <li>2 Bay Leaves</li>
      <li>1 pound fresh small white or brown mushrooms, quartered</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>

<h2> Instructions </h2>

  <hr>

    <ol>
      <li>Simmer bacon rind and fat in water for 10 minutes, remove then proceed to fry lightly in oil. We skipped this and just went straight to frying until crisp and browned</li>
      <li>When beef and veggies are in, Julia suggests to set the casserole in the oven for 4 minutes, then toss the meat and return to the oven for 4 minutes more. We skipped this also and opted to continue cooking over stove top. This didn’t make a difference.</li>
      <li>We added a couple extra cloves of garlic feeling we missed that particular flavour, and added more herbs into the stew.</li>
      <li>Also, Julia prepares her pearl sized onions seperate from the Beef Bourguignon itself, adding them in near the end of cooking. My family completely skipped over the onions in their bowls, eating everything else and leaving them behind. So, the second time around, I added them in with all of the ingredients, saving a pot and stove top cooking time, and the results were better for us. We saved the onions!</li>
      <li>Lastly, Julia asks us to wash out the casserole and return the beef and bacon to it at the end of the recipe. This I couldn’t bring myself to do, wanting to keep every single lick of flavour in that pot.</li>
    </ol>
